# GoPong
Pong clone written in Go using the SDL2 bindings.

# Why ? 
Because it helps me better understand the Go programming language. I find it to be a great middle ground between C and C++ with the benefit of having a larger core library.

# To-do ?
- Add a multiplayer mode (using TCP sockets, nothing fancy here)
- Make the game a little more polished ?
- Add proper menus and difficulty selection (the current one is too easy)
